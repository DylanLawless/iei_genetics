# version 1
* Made from Lawless Genomics project pre 2024.

# version 2
* Made with new IEI genetics page in mind and shared as v1 table on homepage.

# version 3

* Majority of the final version is already completed.

* Changelog starts here.

**Date:** 2025-03-16
* Done - Greek letters: use labels with Greek letters in cells while making them searchable by their Latin counterparts (e.g. "Î±" searchable as "a"); add a comment explaining this functionality.
* Done and quite a pain - Major categories dropdown: enable selection of major categories from a dropdown list, showing original names in the dropdown and abbreviations in the table - remain in global search with hidden column.
* Done - Major categories abbreviations: consider using abbreviations from the paper figure (CID, CID+, PAD, PIRD, PD, IID, AID, CD, BMF) for the first column.
* Done - Implement the abbreviations hover.
* Done - Inheritance adjustments: remove the "sporadic/toxin" category (use "sporadic" for DiGeorge as per IUIS tables) and delete the "variable" inheritance category in the CVID phenotype since it appears only once.
* Done - Immunophenotype presentation: standardise column names to avoid ambiguity (e.g. avoid using "count" where qualitative descriptors such as "defective" are used).
* Done - Systematic conversion errors: correct "Wiedemann-Steiner" (previously misconverted to "Widemann-Steiner"), fix "ICOSL deficiency" (erroneously shown as "ICOSLG deficiency") to reflect correct protein/gene naming, and update "IKZF2 deficiency" to "HELIOS deficiency". And several other trivial errors.
* Terminology definitions: include a clear definition of terminology for cleaned labels, outlining which words were changed and their replacements.

* IRF4 disease entries: resolve the discrepancy of three diseases in the 2024 classification versus only two in the table; review the differentiation between "agamma" and "hypogamma" patients and confirm naming as "IRF4 multimorphic (IRF4 R95T)" and "Primary Antibody deficiency/CI D due to IRF4".
    - There are differences between the 2024 PDF report and the linked xlsx table. Ask Isabelle and Stuart for the most updated version of xlsx. Otherwise we must go with the xlsx.
    - Example: here the PDF manuscript lists three IRF4 - the third IRF4 in Table 6.9 is missing in the xlsx. I have to go with the xlsx version.
    - Agamma and hypogamma label? I would report the IUIS data rather than subjectively change which label is used since they both have meaning.
    - Disease naming: I will clean "IRF4 multimorphic R95T" to "IRF4 multimorphic" but otherwise report IUIS.
* AlphaFold and AlphaMissense data
